I had refactoring these music websites from php to java web.

use the IDEA for devalop.

If you want to run these project, you should configure settings on your computer or server,
then build these project to be a jar pakage by input command like "gradle build".(The project building tools include gradle)

You can find the Spring boot jar pakage at build/libs/xx.jar
input the command like "java -jar xx.jar"
